                    <br><br> Currently, I am working under the guidance of <a href='http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~kolin/Kolins_Web_Home/My_Home.html'>Prof. Kolin Paul</a> at the <a href='https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in//'>Department of Computer Science and Engineering,</a>                    IIT Delhi. We are developing an Embedded System device which can be integrated with an ophthalmoscope. Our device uses a Raspberry Pi-3 processor and a Raspberry Pi camera to record videos of the retina through the ophthalmoscope.
                    The videos are sampled and the resulting images are processed to quantify the amount of Pulsations near the opticla disc by measuring and recording the time variation of diameter of blood vessels. The variations in diameter of the
                    blood vessels are further processed to predict ECG and detect the presence of major systemic vascular diseases, including ischemia, coronary heart diseases, and diabetes mellitus and its complications.<br>

                    <br><br>I Implemented and trained a U-Net model with ResNet inspired residual connections for the segmentation of fetal head from ultrasound images. Used the data from the <a href="https://hc18.grand-challenge.org/">HC18 challenge</a>                    to train the model. I further Implemented Elliptic Hough transform to fit an ellipse to the segmented images. Achieved an average Dice score of 94% on the test data.<br><br>

                    IIT Delhi. We used MATLAB to implement various 4G (LTE and A-LTE) and 5G modulation techniques including OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), SC-FDM (Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing), GFDM ( General Frequency
                    Division Multiplexing), F-OFDM (Filtered OFDM), UFMC (Universal Filter Multi-Carrier modulation) and FBMC (Filter Bank Multi-Carrier modulation). We have setup an Analog Photoinc Link (APL) and have incorporated a wireless transmission
                    link after the APL, using dipole-log periodic and horn antennas. We also analyzed the APL for various characterictics like SFDR (Spurious Free Dynamic Range), DR (Dynamic Range), NF (Noise Figure) and G (Link Gain) through experimental
                    setup. We were analyzing the modulated waveforms after passing them through the APL for various characteristics like EVM (Error Vector Magnitude), BER (Bit Error Rate), PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio), etc.

We developed Felxible KNN (Potassium Sodium Niobate) based tactile sensors. We used sol-gel based method to synthesize KNN inorder to reduce the thermal budget
                    of the devices. We optimized the KNN sol layer and the design of the device. We used metal (Al and W) deposited via PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) technique as the substrate for the devices. We characterized the devices for various
                    parameters like Pressure Sensitivity, Flexibility, Decay rate etc. Data was collected using Labview program and was analyzed using MATLAB.<br> Our work was presented at the <a href='https://www.mrs.org/61st-emc'>EMC (Electronic Materials Conference)</a>                    held at the University of Michigan from June 26, 2019 to June 28, 2019.

We applied high electric field on thin deposited KNN films. We analyzed the effect of the electric field on the material using SEM images, AFM
                    measurements and EDX measurements. We used MATLAB to claculate the percentage volume reduction in the material.<br> Our work was presented at the <a href='https://www.mrs.org/fall2019'>MRS (Materials Research Society)</a> 2019 fall
                    meeting held at Boston, Massachuetts from December 1, 2019 to December 6, 2019. Title of the presentation was "Electric Field assited annealing of KNN thin films for densification",
